# Farmer Profile and Dashboard Fixes - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Default Values Persistence Problem**
- **Problem**: Farmer profiles were created with hardcoded default values ("Default County", "Default Sub-County", "New farmer profile - please update your information") that persisted even after users tried to update them.
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `authController.js` to create profiles with empty/minimal default values
  - Added validation in `FarmerProfile.js` model to reject default values
  - Created cleanup script (`cleanupFarmerProfiles.js`) to clean existing profiles
  - Improved update logic to properly handle clearing of default values

### 2. **Profile Update Functionality Issues**
- **Problem**: Profile updates weren't working correctly, especially for location and description fields
- **Solution**:
  - Completely rewrote the profile update logic in `farmerController.js`
  - Created `FarmerProfileService` for centralized profile data validation and cleaning
  - Added proper handling for different data formats (arrays, objects, strings)
  - Improved error handling and validation

### 3. **Availability/Calendar Functionality**
- **Problem**: Farmer availability system wasn't working properly, no integration with visit booking
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `visitController.js` to properly handle farmer availability
  - Improved `setFarmerAvailability` and `getAvailability` functions
  - Added better validation for time slots and date ranges
  - Fixed relationship between farmer profiles and visits (using user ID instead of profile ID)

### 4. **Farm Visits Display Issues**
- **Problem**: Upcoming farm visits weren't being displayed correctly in farmer dashboard
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `getFarmVisits` to properly filter and display upcoming visits
  - Updated farmer dashboard to include `upcomingVisits` data
  - Fixed visit status handling and farmer-visit relationships
  - Added proper population of adopter information

## Database Changes Required

### Cleanup Existing Data

# Run the cleanup script to fix existing farmer profiles
node src/utils/cleanupFarmerProfiles.js
```

### Or via API (Admin only)
```
POST /api/farmers/cleanup-profiles
```

## API Endpoints Added/Modified

### Farmer Profile
- `PATCH /api/farmers/profile` - Improved with better validation
- `GET /api/farmers/me` - Now includes completion status

### Availability Management
- `GET /api/visits/availability` - Enhanced with date range support

## Frontend Integration Notes

The frontend should now:
1. Handle empty fields properly (no more default values showing)
2. Display profile completion percentage
3. Show upcoming visits in farmer dashboard
4. Provide better error messages during profile updates
5. Support the availability calendar functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Profile Updates**: Test that default values can be cleared and new values persist
2. **Availability**: Test setting, getting, and clearing availability
3. **Visits**: Test visit booking and farmer dashboard display
4. **Validation**: Test that invalid data is properly rejected
5. **Cleanup**: Run cleanup script on existing data

## Future Enhancements

1. Add profile completion progress indicator
2. Implement availability templates (recurring schedules)
3. Add bulk visit management
4. Enhance notification system for visit requests
5. Add analytics for farmer performance

All changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience and data integrity.
